##   
Challenges encountered while building the app:

- Getting comfortable with `reduce()` and `filter()` to compute statistics and game states
- Managing DOM updates efficiently using `createElement` instead of just `innerHTML`
- Ensuring data was correctly parsed and displayed with correct formatting (e.g. `toLocaleString` for large numbers)
